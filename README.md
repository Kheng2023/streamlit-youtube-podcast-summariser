# 📦 Streamlit App: YouTube Podcast Summarizer  

This is a **Streamlit-powered** version of my original **YouTube Podcast Summarizer** script. I created a **simple user interface (UI)** to make it accessible for **non-coders** while maintaining its functionality. The app is **deployed for free** on the **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

## 🚀 Demo App  

Ever listened to a podcast, got inspired by the insights shared, but then realized you can't remember anything afterward? I’ve found myself constantly **replaying parts of an episode** to take notes.  

That’s why I built this app! It helps you **recall key points** from any YouTube podcast **without replaying the entire episode**.  

Give it a try here:
